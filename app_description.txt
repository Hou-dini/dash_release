Dash Puzzle is a Flutter Web Application that is essentially a slide puzzle and 
features two themes: Chamaeleon Cloud I and Dashatar theme.
The app is responsive to different screen sizes and has the functionality of a Progressive
Web Application(PWA). Furthermore, Dash Puzzle is interactive. For example, animated characters
respond to user inputs such as tap/click.
The app supports features such as AppLocalizations, Tool tip, Semantics label, and Audio.
Also, the app allows a user to share their score of the completed puzzle to social media outlets
such as Facebook and Twitter.


Dash puzzle has a responsive layout builder that exposes the layout builder widget to different
screen sizes. Animations in the app are implemented using Rive and take advantage of Rive's
state machine feature to incorporate logic into the animations. For example, an hourglass
animation responds to the state of the puzzle, activating when the puzzle starts. Other animations
respond to a user's input such as tap/click by changing state and responding with a sound.
The puzzle tiles and share your score dialog make use of Flutter's implicit and explicit
animation widgets. For example, puzzle tiles align themselves using AnimatedAlign widget. The
entire puzzle view page is wrapped inside an AnimatedContainer that animates its contents implicitly.
